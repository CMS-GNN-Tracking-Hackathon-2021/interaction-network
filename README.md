# interaction-network

This repo contains a version of the interaction network developed by Gage DeZoort, Savannah Thais et.al in their paper [Charged particle tracking via edge-classifying interactionnetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16701). This was created for the [TrackML dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification), and thei repository is available [here](https://github.com/GageDeZoort/interaction_network_paper). The code in this repo is slightly simplified and adapted to CMSSW data. The main difference is an adaptation to fit the CMSSW Phase 2 geometry. 


This repo is split into the following sections: 

## graph_construction

## models

## plotting
